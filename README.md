# Blockbreaker

## Description
My first mobile game made within unity and its 2d engine. It's rather rudimentary but works as a nice learning experience.

### TODOs/Bugs/UX
- Overall art
- Improve usage of screenspace for the ingame playing area
- Redo game over screen
- "Speed up" button doesn't scale right
- Prevent user thumb covering the end of the targeting line by extending it to the border
- Pressing the hardware back button should close the game (on main menu)
- Saving ignores active balls (therefore you can currently only save between rounds)
